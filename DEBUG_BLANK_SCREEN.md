# Debug Guide for Blank White Screen Issue

## Issue
Getting a blank white screen when accessing `https://www.niteshray.me/privacypolicy/blockit`

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Test Basic Routing
Try these URLs after deploying:
- `https://www.niteshray.me/diagnostic/blockit` - This will show debug information
- `https://www.niteshray.me/test-privacy/blockit` - This is a simple test page

### 2. Check Browser Console
1. Open the privacy policy URL
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for any errors (red text)
5. Check for the debug logs starting with "PrivacyPolicy component mounted"

### 3. Common Causes and Solutions

#### A. CSS/Theme Issue
If the component is loading but appearing white:
- Check if the background classes are working
- Try the diagnostic page which uses inline styles

#### B. Data Loading Issue
If the privacy policy data isn't loading:
- Check console for "policy found: false"
- Verify the data file is being imported correctly

#### C. React Router Issue
If routing isn't working at all:
- Check if the test-privacy route works
- Verify Vercel configuration is deployed

#### D. Build/Deploy Issue
If the component isn't loading:
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Verify all files were uploaded

### 4. Quick Fix Options

#### Option 1: Simplify the Component (Temporary)
Replace the complex PrivacyPolicy component with a simple version temporarily to isolate the issue.

#### Option 2: Add Error Boundary
I've already added error handling, but you can add a React Error Boundary for better error catching.

#### Option 3: Check Network Tab
1. Open DevTools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Reload the page
4. Check if all JS/CSS files are loading (should be 200 status)

### 5. Deploy and Test
After making these changes:
1. Commit and push to GitHub
2. Vercel will auto-deploy
3. Test the diagnostic URLs above
4. Check browser console for error messages

### 6. Report Back
After testing, let me know:
1. What you see in the browser console
2. If the diagnostic page works
3. Any error messages in Vercel deployment logs

This will help identify the exact cause of the blank white screen.
